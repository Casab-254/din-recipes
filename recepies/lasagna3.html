            For years, our Allrecipes community has relied on the saved recipes folder on our site. 
            But let’s be real—favorites from Southern Living, EatingWell, and Food & Wine are just as essential to our cooking routines. 
            That’s why we created a one-stop space to save all your go-to recipes in one beautifully organized page.

Getting started is simple: 
if you already have an account on Allrecipes, 
all you have to do is log in at MyRecipes.com and your previously-saved recipes will be waiting for you, 
plus you can start saving even more. If not, create an account using your email or your Facebook or Google account,
 and start browsing. Explore what’s new, what’s loved, and whatever you’re currently craving.
  Once your profile is set up, you can save any recipe from any of the participating sites by clicking the heart icon in the top corner—making it easy to find when you need it.
To keep things even more organized, you can sort recipes into collections (think food-focused Pinterest boards). 
The default categories—Keepers, Want to Try, and Weeknight Ideas—help you get started,
 but you can also create custom collections like Party Appetizers or Winter Soups to fit your cooking style.

"I just finished exploring MyRecipes and found it very easy to navigate," says Allrecipes Allstar Mary Burns.
 "I was able to easily search for and save my desired recipes in the collections that I created. 
 I like the auto-prompt when you're searching, it makes it faster to find what you're looking for."

And the best part? MyRecipes is constantly growing, with new recipes added regularly.
 It’s backed by some of the most trusted food brands on the internet, 
 including;
